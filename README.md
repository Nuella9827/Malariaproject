# Malaria Impact Tracker in Nigeria (Power BI)

## Overview
This project analyzes malaria data across Nigerian states using **Power BI** to identify hotspots, track trends over time, and forecast future malaria cases.  
The goal is to support public health planning and intervention strategies with clear, interactive visuals.

---

## Key Metrics (KPIs)
- **Total Malaria Cases:** 74M  
- **Total Deaths:** 416K  
- **Cases per 1,000 People:** Calculated per state for hotspot analysis  

These KPIs provide a quick, high-level summary of the malaria situation in Nigeria.

---

## Visualizations

### 1. **Filled Map: State and Cases per 1,000**
- Shows malaria cases per 1,000 people across Nigerian states.
- **Darker shades** highlight states with higher case rates (hotspots).
- Helps decision-makers target high-burden areas.

---

### 2. **Line Chart: Average Malaria Cases by Year**
- Displays malaria case trends year-over-year.
- Useful for analyzing the effectiveness of interventions over time.

---

### 3. **Forecast Chart: Malaria Cases to 2035**
- Predicts malaria case trends into the future based on historical data.
- Includes a **confidence interval** to show the uncertainty range.
- Supports forward-looking health planning.

---

## Features
- **Interactive filters**: Filter data by Year or State.
- **Geospatial Mapping**: Hotspot analysis using Filled Maps
- **Forecasting**: Power BIâ€™s forecasting tool predicts future case trends.
- **KPIs**: Key metrics summarized at the top for quick insights.
